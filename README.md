🚦 Bengaluru Traffic Simulator: The Patience Test

🛵 I am a Daily Bengaluru Traffic Rider

I wanted to show this "patience practicing" page 🧘‍♂️ to anyone visiting Bengaluru for the first time 🇮🇳.

Navigate this virtual traffic for at least 0.5 km 🏁 to know exactly where your patience level stands 📉.

It's just a fun project 🎮 and I used Claude 🤖 to generate this code.

🧐 Why this project?
Bengaluru isn't just a city; it's an emotion. 
And that emotion is usually frustration at the Silk Board junction. I built this to simulate the "joy" of inching forward in bumper-to-bumper traffic.

🌟 Features
Realistic Delays: Experience the thrill of moving 1 meter every 10 minutes ⏳.

AI Powered: Code logic and misery simulation generated by Claude AI.
